# pgeon

Type-safe node-postgres wrapper / extension.

**TODO**
- Mention that the `$query` tagged template cannot be aliased (or try to follow renames), and must be unique.
- Open GitHub issue to ask if nullability information can be obtained.
- Type-check input values!
- Check out "js-to-pg" types map in [pg-types](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-types).
