- Check types and nullability of `returning` clauses of `insert`/`update`/`delete` statements (see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-columns.html and https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/infoschema-attributes.html).
- Check types of placeholders which are part of `where` clauses of `select`/`update`/`delete` statements.
- Check types of placeholders which are part of `values`/`set` clauses of `insert`/`update` statements.
- Check nullability of selected columns in `select` statements.
- Support TypeScript types such as `true`, `1`, `1 | 2`... (compile a minimal TypeScript program to check for type subsets, e.g. `type x = 'abc' extends string ? true : false; let x: x = true`).
- Support statements beyond the basic CRUD or warn when used.
---
- Analyze supported types and JavaScript-to-Postgres type mappings in [pg-types](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-types).
- Separate query parsing and validation logic for potential reuse by other clients (or even other languages).
- Complete `pg-query-native.d.ts` (see https://github.com/lfittl/libpg_query/issues/51).
