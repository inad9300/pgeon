- Check types and nullability of `returning` clauses of `insert`/`update`/`delete` statements.
- Check types of placeholders which are part of `where` clauses of `select`/`update`/`delete` statements.
- Check types of placeholders which are part of `values`/`set` clauses of `insert`/`update` statements.
- Check nullability of selected columns in `select` statements.
- Support TypeScript types such as `true`, `1`, `1 | 2`... (compile a minimal TypeScript program to check for type subsets, e.g. `export const x: true = 'abc' extends string ? true : false`).
- Support statements beyond the basic CRUD or warn when used.
